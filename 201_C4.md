##Links

Links are the defining feature of the web due to the fact that they allow you to move from one web page to another<br>
	This enables the very concept of surfing or browsing<br>

* Some common links
  * Links from one website to another website
	* Links from one page to another page on the same website
	* Links from one part of a web page to another part of the same webpage
	* Links that open in a new browser window
	* Links that start up your email program and address a new email to someone


**WRITING LINKS**
	
* LINKING TO OTHER SITES
	* <a>
	* Users can click on anything between the opening and closing <a> element
	* One specifies which page they want to link utilizing the href attribute
	* The value of the href attribute is the page that you want people to go to when they click on the link
	* When you link to a different website, the value of the href attribute will be the full web address for the site, which is known as an absolute URL.
		* \<a href="http://www.imdbcom">IMDB</a> <br>
		*This is the page 			This is the text
		
	Text between the opening and closing tag is known as link text.
	The link text should explain where visitors will be taken if they click on it
	Clear link text can help visitors find what they want. This will give positive impressions of your site.
	* To write good link text, use words people might use when searching for the page you are linking to.

				
* ABSOLUTE URLS
	* URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator
	* Every web page has its own URL
	* This is a web address that one would type into a browser to visit a specific page
	* Starts with the domain name for that site
	* Followed by the path to a specific page
	* If no page is specified, the site will display the homepage


* LINKING TO OTHER PAGES ON THE SAME SITE
  * \<a>
	* When linking to other pages within the same site, you do not need to specify the domain name in the URL.
	* Use a shorthand known as relative URL
	* If all pages of the site are in the same folder, the the value of the href attribute is the name of the file
	* If different pages of a site in different folders, then a slightly more complex syntax can be used to indicate where the page is in relation to the current page.

* RELATIVE URLS
	* When linking to other pages within the same site, relative URLs are used
	* These are shorthand versions of absolute URLs because you do not need to specify the domain name
	* Relative URLs help when building a site because you can create links between pages without having to set up your domain name or hosting.
	* Relative URLs are also beneficial in learning about HTML because one can create links between pages when they are only on your personal computer.
	* Because you do not need to repeat the domain name in each, they are also quicker to write.
	* If all of the files for the site are in one folder, simply use the file name for that page.
	* If the site is organized into separate folders, tell the browser how to get from the page it currently on to the page that you are linking to.
	* If you link to the same page from two different pages, you'll need to write two different relative URLs.
		
**DIRECTORY STRUCTURE**
* Root folders
	* are the top level folder. This folder contains all of the other files and folders for a website
	* Each section of the site is placed in a separate folder; this helps organize the files.
* Relationships
	* Relationships between files and folders on a website is described using the same terminology as a family tree
	* Parent folders hold the subfolders/files called children
* Homepages
	* Main homepage is writeen in HTML
	* Each section in a child folder is called index.html
	* Web servers are usually set up to return the index.html file if no file is specified
		
	If working with a content management system individual files for each page might not exist. These systems often use one template file. Editing the template would change all the pages that use the template. Therefore do not change any code that is not HTML or you might break the page.
	
	Every page and every image on a website has a URL. This URL is made up of the domain name followed by the path to that page or image
	Use URLs when linking to other web pages and when including images in your own site.
	
**EMAIL LINKS**
	* mailto:
	 * To create a link that starts up the user's email program and addresses an email to a specified email address, use tha <a> element. However, this time the value of the href attribute starts with mailto: and is followed bu the email address you want to email to be sent to.
	
			
**OPENING LINKS IN A NEW WINDOW**
* Target
	* To open in a new window, use the target attribute on the opening <a> tag. The value of this attribute should be _blank.
	* A common reason a web author might want a link to open in a new window is if it points to another website. 
	* Avoid opening links in a new window, but if you do, it is considered good practice to inform users that the link will open a new window before they click on it.
		

**LINKING TO A SPECIFIC PART OF THE SAME PAGE**
	* If your web page is long, you might want to add a list of contents that links to the corresponding sections lower down. 
	* Might want to add a link towards the bottom of the page which brings users all the way back to the top, that way they don't have to scroll all the way up
	* It is necessary to identify the ponts in the page that the linnk will go to
	* Do this by utilizing id attribute (which can be utilized on every HTML element.
	* The value of the id attribute should start with a letter or underscore (not a number or any other character) and on a single page. Now two id attributes should have the same value
	* To link an element that uses an id attribute, use the <a> element again, but the value of the href attribute starts with the # symbol, followed by the value of the id attribute of the element you want to link to

	**LINKING TO A SPECIFIC PART OF ANOTHER PAGE**
	* mUse a similar technique to same page linking
	* Ensure that the page has id attributes that identify specific parts of the page
	* Simply add the same syntax to the end of the link for that page
	* The href attribute will contain the address for the page (either absolute URL or relative URL) followed by the # symbol, followed by the value of the id attribute that is used on the element you are linking to.
