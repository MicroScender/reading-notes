## Text
**Structural Markup:**<br>
	Elements that are used to describe both headings and paragraphs<br>
**Semantic Markup:**<br> 
- Provides extra information; 
	 - Where emphasis is placed in a sentence
	 - That something written is a quotation

	 - The meaning of acronyms
		

**HEADINGS** <br>
HTML has six levels of headings <br>
* \<h1> used for main headings
* \<h2> used for subheadings
* \<h3-6> any further sections under subheading
	* Browsers display contents at different sizes.
		* \<h1> is the largest
		* \<h6> is the smallest
		* These sizes can be adjusted by utilizing CSS

**PARAGRAPHS**<br>
\<p> <br>
Paragraphs are created with a left bracket, p, and right bracket. This element/tag will separate paragraphs if opened and closed in between each.
* Paragraphs consist of one or more sentences that form a self contained unit of discourse.
* The start of the paragraph is just behind the opening tag \<p>
* Text is easier to understand when split into units of text.
	* Books have chapters
	* Chapters have subheadings
	* Subheadings will have paragraphs
		
**BOLD**<br>
	\<b> <br>
	\</b> <br>

**VISUAL EDITOR** <br> 
* Content management systems and HTML editors such as Dreamweaver have two views of the page you are creating: a visual editor and a code view.
	* Content management system is an application that is used to manage content, allowing multiple contributors to create, edit and publish.
* Visual editors:
	* Resemble word processors
		* Headings are created by highlighting text and using a drop down to select a heading
		* Bold and italic text are created by highlighting some text and pressing a b or I button
		* New paragraphs are created using the return or enter key
		* Line breaks are created by pressing the shift key and the return key at the same time
		* Horizontal rules are created using a button with a straight line on it 

**CODE VIEWS** <br>

* Activated using a button with an icon that says HTML or angled brackets

## CSS
**Cascading Style Sheets** <br>
* Allows creation of rules that specify how the content of the element should appear

			* Property
				* Indicate the aspects of the element you want to change
					* Color, font, width, height, border,
			* Value
				* Specify the settings you want to use for chosen properties
					* To specify color property, the value is the color 0u want the text to be

**Block Elements** <br>
* Look as though they start on a new line
	* \<h1>, \<p>, \<div>
**Inline Elements** <br>
* Flow within the text
	* \<b>,\<i>, \<img>, \<em>, \<span> <br>

By using CSS you can add a border around any box, specify width and height, or add a background color. Text can also be controlled inside a box.

**Example Styles** <br>

	* Width and height
	* Borders (color, width, ad style)
	* Background color and images
	* Position in the browser window
* Text
	* Typeface

	* Color
	* Italics, bold, uppercase
	* Lowercase, small-caps
		
**External CSS** <br>
* \<link>
* Href
* Type 
* Rel
	
**Internal CSS** <br>
	/<style>
	
**CSS Selectors** <br>
* Universal
	* /* {}
* Type
	* H1, h2, h3 {}
* Class
	* .note {}
	* P.note {}
* ID
	* \# {}
* Child
	* Li>a {}
* Descendant
	* P a {}
* Adjacent sibling
	* H1+p {}
* General sibling
	* H1~p {}
		
**Understanding how CSS rules cascade means you can write simpler style sheets because you can create generic rules that apply to most elements and then override the properties on the individual elements that need to appear differently
