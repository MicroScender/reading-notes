# Notes from [CodeFellows_GH_DomainModeling](https://github.com/codefellows/domain_modeling#domain-modeling)
**Domain Modeling**
* process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem.
* describes
  * entities
  * attributes
  * behaviors
  * problem domain constraints
 * when written well, will verify and validate the understanding of specific stakeholder problems
 
 ----
 Description for below
 * constructor function defined using function expression
  * EpicFailVideo declared and assigned functions 
    * epicRating
    * hasAnimals
 * when called, data inside parameters is stored in
  * this.epicRating
  * this.hasAnimals<br>
*data stored within properties can be accessed by newly created objects*
 * two objects are then instantiated with *new* keyword 
 * these obects are created by calling the EpicFailVideo constructor function
  * parkourFail
  * corgiFail<br>      
  
  let EpicFailVideo =function(epicRating, hasAnimals) {<br>
    this.epicRating =epicRating;<br>
    this.hasAnimals + hasAnimals;<br>
   }
   
   let parkourFail =new EpicFailVideo(7,false);<br>
   let corgiFail = new EpicFailVideo(4,true);<br>
   console.log(parkourFail);<br>
   console.log(corgiFail);<br>
