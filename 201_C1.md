# Pre-Readings

## Structure 

There is a message that is being conveyed in all documents and the more structured that document is, the likely hood of the message reaching the viewer raises.

HTML describes the structure of a web page<br>
HyperText Markup Language

* Headings and sub headings reflects a hierarchy of information
* When creating a document, we separate out the text to give it structure

HTML code is made up of characters that live inside angled brackets.<br>
* These are called HTML elements.
* Elements are made up of two tags
	* Opening tag
	* Closing tag
		* The closing tag has an extra forward slash in it
Each element tells the browser something about the information that sits between its opening and closing tags <br>

 * The opening \<html> tag indicates that anything in between it and the closing \</html> tag is HTML code.
 * \<body> tag indicates all between it and the closing \</body> tag should be inside the main browser window
 * \<h1> and \</h1> is the main heading
 * \<p> and \</p> holds a paragraph
 * \<h2> and \</h2> form a sub heading
 * \<p> and \</p> for a sub heading paragraph
 * \</body> indicates the endo of what appears in the main browser window
 * \<html> indicates that it is the end of the HTML code

Characfters in the brackets indicate the tag/elements purpose <br>
* Tag and element are used interchangeably

Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element <br>
* The appear at the opening tag of the element and are made up of two parts separated by an = sign
*	Name: 
	*	indicates what kind of extra information about elements content is being supplied. Should be in lower case
*	Value:
	*	The information or setting for the attribute
	* \<p lang="en-us">Paragraph in english\</p>
	*	The attribute is called lang and is used to indicate language in this element
	* The value specifies it is in english

Not all attributes can be used on all elements though some attributes, like lang, can appear on any element.
* Most values are pre-defined or follow a stipulated format.
* The value of lang attribute is an abbreviated way of specifying which language is used, which all browsers understand.

BODY, HEAD, TITLE

\<body>
	Everything inside is shown in the main browser
\<head>
	Comes before the \<body> element.
	Contains information about the page rather than information that is within
	located in the main part of the browser window
	Usually holds a \<title> element
\<title>
	Contents are shown in the top of the browser, above the URL or on the tab for that page
	
**HTML** stands for *HyperText Markup Language*
HyperText allows one to create links to allow visitors to move from page to page quickly and easily.
Allows annotated text which provide additional meaning to the contents of a document

*WHEN SAVING A NOTEPAD FILE, MAKE SURE THAT THE FILE IS SAVED WITH A .HTML AND ALL FILES FROM THE DROPDOWN.

Even thought the directions were pretty straightforward I still found a way to mess this up and had to struggleâ€¦the good thing is that I ended up figuring out the answer on my own though.

HTML pages are text documents
* HTML uses tags/elements
*	Tags/elements
	*	Characters that sit inside angled brackets (less than, greater than)
	*	They give the information they surround special meaning
	*	They usually come in pairs
		*	Opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content
		*	Closing tag denotes the end
	*	Opening tags can carry attributes which give more information about the content of the element
		*	Attributes
			*	Require a name and value
**To learn HTML**
	* *Know what tags are available
	* *Know what these tags do
	* *Know where these tags go

## Extra Markup

There have been several versions of HTML since it's creation. 
*We are now using HTML5.

**HTML5**
* authors do not need to close all tags
* new elemtns and attributes

**DOCTYPES**
\<!DOCTYPE html>
* each page should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration
* tells the browser which version of HTML is being utilized
* helps render the page correctly

**Comments in HTML**
\<!-- -->
* used to add comments to code which won't be visible to the user
* comments make your code easier to understand
* comments can be read by anyone looking at the source code behind the page
* comments can stop blocks of code from being displayed in the browser
