# Markdown Syntax 

What is this coding stuff? How does one even communicate with the machines?

Well, **syntax** is defined as the *arrangement of words and phrases to create well-formed sentences in a language.*
Cool! Easy, right? Well, thanks to cheat sheets provided by those who came before, absolutely. If you have patience.
So coding is basically writing in such a way that a computer can decipher what you're trying to tell it to do. Organization 
and punction are key. 

Luckily, these programming languages provide grammar, or elements, which allow you to organize your thoughts
in such a way, that the computer will project forward. GitHub provides a platform to project yourself into the arms of the world wide 
web by utilization of what's called **markdown syntax**. Using markdown syntax in GitHub seems like great practice to transition into all 
sorts of different programming languages.
