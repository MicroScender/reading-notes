## About Me
Heyo! My name's Joseph and this is one of my first Code Fellows assignments about *Growth Mindset*.

### On obtaining a Growth Mindset.

Obtaining a growth mindset seems difficult to achieve and maintain. This seems to be more so true for those of us not conditioned, from childhood, to practice such psychology. My life experience has reminded me daily that keeping a growth mindset requires an immense amount of awareness and an ability to let go of attachment. As Rumi once said, "Whenever they rebuild an old building, they must first of all destroy the old one." There is more to the **Growth Mindset** than awareness, lack of attachment, and the ability to begin anew. 

1. Challenging yourself to break through Obstacles
2. Maintaining a consistent Effort
3. Being open to Criticism and the Success of Others
