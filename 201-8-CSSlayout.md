## Layout
oveview of methods available when building a page component

### Display
determines if the box it is applied to acts as inline or block and determines how an element's children should behave.
* Inline: behave like words in a sentence by sitting next to each other in the inline direction
  * elements like /<span> and /<strong> inline by default
  * explicit width and height annot be set on inline elements
  * block level margin and padding will be ignored by surrounding elements
* Block
  * do not sit next alongside eachother by crearting a new line for themselves
  * will expand to inline dimension size unless changed by other CSS code
  * spans full width in horizontal writing mode, unless changed
  * margin on all sides of block is respected
* Margin
* Padding

### Flexbox and Grid 
These create layout rules for multiple elements. Though they share similarities, they solve different layout problems.
* Flexbox: layout mechanism for one-dimensional layouts.
  * layout across a single axis either horizontally or verticall
  * will inline element's children and stretch them in block direction to so all are same height
