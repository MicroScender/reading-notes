# JavaScript function 
- is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
- is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).


### JavaScript Function Syntax
- defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().
- contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).
- parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
(parameter1, parameter2, ...)
- code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}
- parameters are listed inside the parentheses () in the function definition.
- arguments are the values received by the function when it is invoked.
- inside the function, the arguments (the parameters) behave as local variables.

#### You "Define a function" and "Declare a variable"
