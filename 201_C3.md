# Duckett. HTML & CSS. Ch. 13 Boxes
  
## BOXES
CSS treats each HTML element as though it resides within it's own box. You can change the appearance of these boxes by setting certain properties. <br>
  
 
**Box Dimensions** <br>
usually a boxes is sized such to barely hold it's contents. you can use the height and width properties to change this default setting.   
 * Width
 * Height <br>
ways to change box size
 * pixels
   * allows programmer to accurately control size
 * percentages
   * size shifts according to the size of the box which the box resides in
 * ems
   * the size of the text effects the size shifts
   * best utilized when writing code for cross platform usage
  
**Limiting width** <br>
page designs can expand and shrink to adapt to the suze of the user's screen. min-width specifies the smallest size a box can be displayed on a narrow window and vice versa for max-width on a wide browser.
 * ensures contents of page is legible

## Array
* is a unique type of variable
* stores a list of values
* use an array when working with a list
* use an array when working with values that are related to each other
* number of values held does not need to be specified
* seperated by commas
  * ex. array literal \var variablename1 <br>
                       variablename =['value1,value2,value3]; <br>
                       var variablename2 = document.getElementById('variablename1');
                       el.textContent = variablename1[0];
