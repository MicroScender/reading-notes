## Loops
- Loops are used in JavaScript to perform repeated tasks based on a condition. 
- Conditions typically return true or false . 
- will continue running until the defined condition returns false 
- For loops
  - control how many iterations occur
- While loops
  - will run until a condition is met

For loop is an iterative statement and is not a function, but you can have a loop inside of a function

## Operators
- special symbol used to perform operations on operands (values and variables). 
*For example, 2 + 3; // 5. Here + is an operator that performs addition, and 2 and 3 are operands.*
