### CSS

Allows you to create great-looking web pages. CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users — how they are styled, laid out, etc.
CSS can be used for very basic document text styling — for example, for changing the color and size of headings and links. It can be used to create a layout — for example, turning a single column of text into a layout with a main content area and a sidebar for related information. It can even be used for effects such as animation. Have a look at the links in this paragraph for specific examples.

### Css syntax

CSS is a rule-based language — you define the rules by specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page.
he CSS rule opens with a selector . This selects the HTML element that we are going to style. We then have a set of curly braces { }.
Inside the braces will be one or more declarations, which take the form of property and value pairs. We specify the property (color in the above example) before the colon, and we specify the value of the property after the colon (red in this example).

### CSS properties 

have different allowable values, depending on which property is being specified. In our example, we have the color property, which can take various color values. We also have the font-size property. This property can take various size units as a value.

### Css modules

- Language is broken down into modules
- i.e. backgrounds and borders module holds background-color and border-color

### Css specifications

- HTML,CSS,Javascript are defined in giant documents called specifcations.
- Published by standards organizations like W3C, WHATWG, ECMA, Khronos and define how those technologies are supposed to behave

Css is constantly developing
Developers work to update without breaking old websites
